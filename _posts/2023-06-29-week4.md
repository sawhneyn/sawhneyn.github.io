I had an early meeting with Dr. Mishra to seek clarification on challenging aspects of the assignment. One specific issue was encountering "nan" values for precision and F1-Score in my code. I had overlooked essential columns required for accurate calculations. For example, when calculating the baseline start time and end time, I tend to overlooked the time offset values for Empatica data. Also, Dr. Mishra wanted me to continue to highlight Dr. Mishra provided valuable guidance, explaining the necessary adjustments to rectify the problem.

Additionally, Dr. Mishra outlined the next steps in my research project. This involved extracting data from the RespiBAN dataset and employing the FLIRT module library for precise datatable extraction. I learned important techniques such as downsampling, filtering, and extracting R-R intervals for R-peaks. This allows me to use FLIRT library on RespiBAN data. These data processing exercises significantly enhanced my skills and understanding on data processing techniques and such. 

I dedicated a significant portion of my time this week to address these challenges and engage in learning opportunities. As a result, I feel well-prepared and enthusiastic to continue my research. The past few weeks have been instrumental in my personal and professional growth.
