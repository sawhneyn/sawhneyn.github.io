Upon my return, I promptly resumed my work, implementing the changes recommended by the grad student to address the issues encountered in the classification models. This involved a meticulous process of refining the code, making it more organized, and ensuring that it met the necessary standards for final submission. Simultaneously, I focused on obtaining the conclusive values for the graduate school, finalizing all aspects of my work.

Despite the challenges in coordinating with Dr. Mishra, owing to his busy schedule and being out of town for a conference, I persevered. It wasn't until October 17th that I was able to connect with him. During our meeting, I presented the final results of my work, incorporating the adjustments suggested by both the grad student and Dr. Mishra. With their feedback and approval, I officially completed my assigned tasks and concluded my contribution to the project.
