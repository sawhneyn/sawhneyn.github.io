My primary goal was to create six classification models, delving into the intricacies of HRV, EDA, and HRV+EDA data from both WESAD Empatica and WESAD RespiBAN datasets. With 14 participants' data for training and one participant for testing, I aimed to repeat the process 15 times to ensure the models' robustness and reliability. As I navigated through this complex task, I encountered both triumphs and hurdles that contributed to my personal and professional growth.

The process of building the classification models was not without its challenges. While coding for the Empatica and RespiBAN datasets, I encountered ValueErrors that initially perplexed me. However, with tenacity and support from Dr. Mishra, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve these issues. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance in the face of obstacles and reinforced the significance of seeking guidance when needed.

As I completed the coding for both datasets, I noticed some unusual metric values, particularly NaN, which required further investigation. Through careful examination of my code and consultations with Dr. Mishra, I discovered that these values resulted from missing data and inconsistent preprocessing. Armed with this insight, I made the necessary adjustments to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the classification models.

In an effort to optimize the model's performance, I decided to experiment with different classification algorithms. I transitioned from using RandomForestClassifier to Support Vector Machines (SVM), hoping that SVM's unique capabilities would lead to improved results. This experimentation not only broadened my understanding of machine learning techniques but also reinforced the significance of evaluating various methodologies to achieve optimal outcomes.

Amidst my research endeavors, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the HCC conferenceâ€”an enlightening experience that left a lasting impact. The conference brought together a diverse community of professors and researchers from various fields. I had the privilege of engaging with experts working on everything from cutting-edge games to innovative personal informatics projects. Collaborating with these seasoned professionals not only expanded my horizons but also sparked new ideas and potential collaborations.

Moreover, interacting with fellow PhD students was an enjoyable and enriching experience. Sharing our research interests and experiences created a supportive and encouraging environment, fostering meaningful connections and the exchange of ideas.

As this eventful week comes to a close, I find myself filled with a renewed sense of purpose and determination. Overcoming challenges in data modeling and embracing the learning opportunities has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of collaborative efforts and seeking guidance from mentors. Moving forward, I am excited to implement the knowledge gained from these experiences and continue my research journey with newfound enthusiasm and confidence.
