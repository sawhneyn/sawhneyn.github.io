Even after incorporating the one-hour adjustment to the time values, I observed persistent issues with several patients from the clinical dataset when executing the classification models. Some patients, for instance, exhibited only stress classification without a corresponding baseline. In other instances, suspicions arose that incorrect data had been provided, given the significant disparities between the start and end times and the actual time values of the readings. To address these challenges, I reached out to the grad student once again, detailing the various issues I encountered.

Due to the nature of these challenges being rooted in data quality, I had to await guidance from the grad student. Unfortunately, he was occupied with prior commitments, leading to a delay in his availability to provide assistance. Patiently waiting for him to conclude his commitments, we finally scheduled a meeting on 9/22/2023 to thoroughly discuss the issues. During our meeting, he assured me that he would review the identified problems later that day.

Moreover, I had pre-existing commitments during the week of 9/25/2023, which regrettably hindered my ability to work on addressing these issues during that period. Despite these challenges, the meeting with the grad student and the commitment to resolving the data quality concerns marked a pivotal step toward finding solutions and ensuring the robustness of the classification models.
