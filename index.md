## About Me
I am an MSCS Align Student at Northeastern University, excited to embark on a summer 2023 research experience as part of the DREAM program at the UbiWell Lab. With a profound interest in health informatics and a strong background in healthcare, I am eager to merge my two passions and contribute to groundbreaking advancements in this field. My undergraduate degree in biology has equipped me with a solid foundation in life sciences, enabling me to understand the intricacies of healthcare systems and the potential for leveraging technology to drive improvements. Joining the UbiWell Lab aligns perfectly with my aspirations to apply my technical skills and domain knowledge to health informatics. I am thrilled to collaborate with a diverse team of researchers and experts.

## About My Advisor

Dr. Varun Mishra is an esteemed assistant professor at Northeastern University, holding a joint appointment with the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. His research focuses on leveraging ubiquitous technologies to enable effective digital interventions for mental and behavioral health outcomes. Dr. Mishra received his doctorate in computer science from Dartmouth College and conducted postdoctoral research at the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health. 

His research goal is to develop data-driven technologies for digital interventions in mental and behavioral health. He is dedicated to exploring and advancing the complete "lifecycle" of mental and behavioral health sensing and intervention. This encompasses accurately sensing and detecting various conditions such as stress and opioid use, identifying optimal timing for intervention delivery based on user receptivity, and selecting the most effective mechanisms and modalities for just-in-time delivery and accessibility of interventions. He emphasizes accurate sensing and detection of states-of-vulnerability and identifying states-of-receptivity for interventions. 

Dr. Varun Mishra leads a range of innovative projects that focus on advancing digital health interventions. These include causal modeling for physiological stress, predicting relapse during OUD treatment using contextual and sensor data, and evaluating states-of-receptivity for digital health interventions. Through these projects, Dr. Mishra and his team are at the forefront of research, contributing to the understanding and application of data-driven technologies that have the potential to improve mental and behavioral health outcomes.


## About My Project

The UbiWell Lab has gathered EDA (Electrodermal Activity) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) data from a diverse group of participants using wearable technology. This project aims to utilize the clinical data collected to examine the adequacy of HRV as an informative measure for specific body conditions, determining instances where it proves to be an equivalent indicator compared to EDA. Additionally, the project seeks to investigate cases where EDA outperforms HRV as a superior indicator for certain conditions. The analysis will involve employing data mining techniques and leveraging single processing capabilities in Python. By undertaking this research, we aim to enhance our understanding of the strengths and limitations of both HRV and EDA in assessing various physiological states.
