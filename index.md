## About Me
I am an MSCS Align Student at Northeastern University, excited to embark on a summer 2023 research experience as part of the DREAM program at the UbiWell Lab. With a profound interest in health informatics and a strong background in healthcare, I am eager to merge my two passions and contribute to groundbreaking advancements in this field. My undergraduate degree in biology has equipped me with a solid foundation in life sciences, enabling me to understand the intricacies of healthcare systems and the potential for leveraging technology to drive improvements. Joining the UbiWell Lab aligns perfectly with my aspirations to apply my technical skills and domain knowledge to health informatics. I am thrilled to collaborate with a diverse team of researchers and experts.

## About My Advisor

Dr. Varun Mishra is an esteemed assistant professor at Northeastern University, holding a joint appointment with the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. His research focuses on leveraging ubiquitous technologies to enable effective digital interventions for mental and behavioral health outcomes. Dr. Mishra received his doctorate in computer science from Dartmouth College and conducted postdoctoral research at the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health. 

His research goal is to develop data-driven technologies for digital interventions in mental and behavioral health. He is dedicated to exploring and advancing the complete "lifecycle" of mental and behavioral health sensing and intervention. This encompasses accurately sensing and detecting various conditions such as stress and opioid use, identifying optimal timing for intervention delivery based on user receptivity, and selecting the most effective mechanisms and modalities for just-in-time delivery and accessibility of interventions. He emphasizes accurate sensing and detection of states-of-vulnerability and identifying states-of-receptivity for interventions. 

Notably, Dr. Mishra has made significant contributions in stress detection research. His reproducible methods have shown that commodity devices can perform on par with clinical-grade sensors. By incorporating contextual information alongside physiological signals, Dr. Mishra improves stress detection accuracy. His work emphasizes the importance of delivering interventions at the right time when individuals need support and are receptive to it. Through interdisciplinary collaborations and a commitment to reproducibility, Dr. Mishra strives to advance the field of digital health interventions and contribute to the design and implementation of future mHealth solutions.
